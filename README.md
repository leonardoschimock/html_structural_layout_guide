# html_structural_layout_guide
A basic HTML layout skeleton used as a structural reference and positioning guide for ***front-end development practice.***

This repository contains a basic HTML structural skeleton designed as a visual and positional layout reference.
It serves as a foundational guide for understanding page structure, element positioning, spacing, and content organization before building a complete website.

The project ***is not a finished website***, but rather a structural blueprint for layout experimentation and development practice.
